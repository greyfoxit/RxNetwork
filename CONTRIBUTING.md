# Contributing

## Looking for help?

You have the following options:
- Check out documentation in `README.md` file and read it carefully. It covers almost everything 
what is important.
- Browse JavaDoc at http://greyfox.github.io/RxNetwork/
- [Ask the question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=rxnetwork2).
- Provide detailed information about the problem and environment, then ask the question in the 
new GitHub issue.

## Found a bug?

Provide detailed steps to reproduce and make sure this bug is not related to your custom project or 
environment. Ideally, create Pull Request with failing unit test (or more tests).

## Want a feature or improvement?

This is tiny library and we would like to avoid overcomplicating it, but if you think a new feature
would be useful and make this project better, then create a new issue. After that, we can discuss it 
and work on a Pull Request.

## Want to create a Pull Request?

Before creating new Pull Request, please create a new issue and discuss the problem.
If we agree that PR will be reasonable solution, then fork repository, create a separate branch
and work on a feature or bug-fix on this branch. When you're done, make sure that project passes
static code analysis verification with `./gradlew check` command. 

When you performed more commits than one, squash them into one within a single PR. Make sure that 
your commit message is descriptive enough. If not, then use `git commit --amend` command and change 
it.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order 
to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make sure your code compiles and passes
static code analysis verification with `./gradlew check` command.
